1. Sustainability: The ability to maintain or support a process continuously over time without depleting
resources or causing harm to the environment.

2. Artificial Intelligence (AI): The simulation or mimicking of human intelligence (the ability to problem
solve, make decisions, learn, and adapt) and beyond through machines and computers.

3. Conservation: The protection, preservation, and careful management of natural resources and the
environment to prevent exploitation, destruction, or neglect.

4. Renewable Resources: Natural resources that can be replenished naturally over short periods, such as
solar energy, wind energy, and biomass.

5. Machine Learning: A field within Artificial Intelligence that uses data and algorithms to learn and
adapt without explicit instructions.

6. Computer Vision: A field of AI that enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual
data from the world, such as recognizing objects, scenes, or activities in images or videos.

7. Carbon Footprint: The total amount of greenhouse gasses, particularly carbon dioxide, that are
emitted directly or indirectly by human activities, usually expressed as equivalent tons of carbon
dioxide (CO2 ).

8. Circular Economy: An economic system aimed at minimizing waste and making the most of
resources by reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products.

9. Optimization: The process of making something as effective, perfect, or functional as possible, often
by using data and algorithms to improve efficiency.

10. Ecosystem: A biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment, working
together as a system.
