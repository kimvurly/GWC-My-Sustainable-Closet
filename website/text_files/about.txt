            MAIN FEATURE: Outfit planner, similar to stylebook but uses the recommendations made by the AI 
            to make outfits with clothes that are already in the user's closet
            <p>
                All clothes in the user's closet can be put into the system manually via search and links, 
                but the user can also just take a photo of their clothes and the AI will use image identification 
                to find the piece of clothing online
            </p>
            <p>
                The recommended pieces of clothing that the AI recommends after the user uses the swiping mechanism 
                will be available to plan and design outfits.

                When a user first signs into their account, they will be met with a blank screen indicating that 
                they haven't “started swiping” yet. Swiping is essentially a way for the application to get the know 
                the user's style and preferences. There will be a button at the top left that says “start swiping” and 
                they will begin the swiping.

                Swiping: The user is presented with an outfit that may or may not be of their taste. They will indicate 
                whether or not they like it. When they click one of the buttons, the image is stored in a database for the 
                AI to later analyze. The user has to swipe on more and more outfits if they want their recommendations to be 
                more accurate. 
            </p>

                By using the data from the swiping mechanism, the AI provides the user with sustainable fashion brands that produce 
                clothing of the same style. The application will hopefully partner with other sustainable fashion apps, such as Depop 
                and Poshmark to achieve the next part. The AI will also have access to data from Depop and Poshmark that includes 
                images of clothes that users are currently selling. The AI will then put these listings on the user's front page 
                and lead them to the Depop or Poshmark link.

                Liked outfits and styles are in another section of the web app. Lists the different styles that the user likes. 
                User can also manually input their own styles if they know themselves and think the AI isn't good enough. The AI 
                will display a variety of outfits that are of the manually imputed style(s) and dive even deeper into the user's 
                preferences.

                Convolutional neural network: If the user doesn't want to swipe a lot, they can simply provide a photo of inspiration 
                for an outfit that they really like. The AI will then scan the database of online thrifting brands and find clothes to 
                build the outfit for the user.

            AI chatbot and convolutional neural network for image identification that provides unique ways the user can turn their old 
            clothing into something new based on their preferences
            <p>
                After swiping and letting the AI collect data on what styles and clothing they like, the user will unlock a feature 
                that encourages upcycling. If the user has old clothing they would like to recycle, they can take a picture of the 
                clothing and provide a brief description of its dimensions. Then, the user can either choose to generate a random idea 
                based on their preferences or send in a photo of a piece of clothing they'd like to recreate with their old piece of 
                clothing.
